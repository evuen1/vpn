						<h2>We Do Not Identify You</h2>
						<br><br>
						<p>At Switcherry, we stand behind our commitment to user privacy and security. When you access our websites and use our best-in-class VPN products, you’ll share some information with us, which we use to provide and improve our products, send notifications and updates, troubleshoot, and to support our free product through advertising. Our goal is to be upfront about what we collect, how we use it and whom we share it with, and that’s why we’ve written this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy also tells you about your rights and choices with respect to your information, and how you can contact us if you have any questions or concerns. Below is a snapshot of some of our important privacy practices, but please read the full Policy for more detail. If you have any questions about anything in this Policy, please feel free to reach out to us at <a href="mailto:info@vpn-connect.com">info@vpn-connect.com</a>.</p>
						<br><br><br>
						<h2>Privacy Overview</h2>
						<br><br>
						<ul>
							<li>Our VPN product will never store or log your IP address beyond the duration of your VPN session, and we always delete your IP address after you disconnect from the VPN.</li>
							<li>We do not keep logs of your online activities and never associate any domains, or applications that you access while the Switcherry VPN is connected with you, your device, or your email.</li>
						</ul>
						<br><br><br>
						<h2>Security Overview</h2>
						<br><br>
						<p>When the Switcherry VPN is connected, we encrypt all of the traffic between your device and our servers, using different secure algorithms. Your web traffic on unsecured networks such as public Wi-Fi at cafes, airports, etc. is always securely encrypted when the Switcherry VPN is connected.</p>
